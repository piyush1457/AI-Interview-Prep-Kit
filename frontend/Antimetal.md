# Antimetal - Style Reference
> editorial observatory on cream paper - a quiet morning in a research journal where restraint signals confidence and the serif does the heavy lifting

**Theme:** light

Source measurements are normalized; roles and recommendations are interpreted. Font summary lists are independent, not paired by position. HTML examples are reconstructions, not source components.

Antimetal operates in a quiet editorial register: warm cream paper, a distinctive contemporary serif (Test Signifier) at weight 400 for every headline, and an almost entirely achromatic palette where color appears only as a small constellation of decorative dots and a single muted chartreuse accent. The visual grammar borrows from print design - drop caps, pull quotes, section numbering in tracked monospace, dashed hairline dividers - rather than from typical SaaS dashboards. Components are flat and pill-shaped; the navigation is a liquid-glass capsule; borders are dashed 1px at 10% black opacity. Everything whispers, even the CTA. The serif at regular weight doing the work of bold is the single most defining choice: Antimetal does not shout authority, it earns it through typographic restraint and generous breathing room.

## Tokens - Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Parchment | `#d7d7d0` | `--color-parchment` | Page canvas - warm gray field that recedes behind content, used as the dominant full-bleed background |
| Cream | `#f7f6f3` | `--color-cream` | Primary surface - card backgrounds, FAQ rows, section bands, pulled slightly warmer than white to avoid clinical feel |
| Bone | `#fdfcfa` | `--color-bone` | Elevated card surface - nearly white with a faint warm cast, for content blocks that need to feel slightly above the cream layer |
| Bistre | `#1a1614` | `--color-bistre` | Primary text, dark filled buttons, active strokes - warm near-black that replaces pure #000, never harsh on the cream |
| Graphite | `#66635f` | `--color-graphite` | Secondary body text, nav labels, supporting copy - the workhorse mid-tone that keeps paragraphs quiet |
| Flint | `#a8a7a1` | `--color-flint` | Muted helper text, dashed dividers, disabled chrome, low-emphasis stroke - sits between graphite and the canvas |
| Slate | `#53504c` | `--color-slate` | Tertiary text and sub-labels - slightly darker than graphite for labels that need quiet emphasis |
| Ash | `#2a2724` | `--color-ash` | Hover/pressed state on dark buttons and video timestamp chips - a mid-point between bistre and black |
| Quill | `#e3e3de` | `--color-quill` | Hairline dividers, ghost button borders, nav capsule background, tab resting surface - the lightest warm gray that still reads as a line |
| Chartreuse Whisper | `#e2e67d` | `--color-chartreuse-whisper` | Sole chromatic accent - appears as a small punctuation mark, badge fill, or highlight wash; deliberately desaturated so it never dominates |

## Components

### Dark Pill Button
**Role:** Primary action CTA - the only filled button in the system

Background #1a1614, text #f4f4e7, full-pill radius 9999px, padding 12.5px vertical / 24.5px horizontal, font Geist 14px weight 500. The warm dark fill on warm cream paper reads as confident rather than aggressive. Used for "Book a demo" and primary conversions. Never appears more than once per viewport.

### Ghost Outlined Button
**Role:** Secondary action - paired with the dark pill to create contrast without competing for attention

Transparent background, border 1px solid in current text color at 92% opacity (#1a1614 at 0.92), text #1a1614, radius 0px (rectangular not pill), padding 24px on all sides, Geist 14px weight 500. The sharp corners deliberately contrast the pill's softness, making the two-button pair read as a typographic rhythm rather than a hierarchy of importance.

### Liquid-Glass Navigation Capsule
**Role:** Sticky top navigation with backdrop-filter blur

Floating pill shape with radius 82px, backdrop-filter blur(8–24px) saturate(1.75–1.8) brightness(1.1), semi-transparent fill #cfcfc8bd, inset shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 0 10px 0 for depth, 1px hairline border. Internal layout: left-aligned secondary links, centered wordmark with antimetallic icon glyph, right-aligned sign-in + dark pill CTA. Sits over content with visible refraction.

### FAQ Accordion Row
**Role:** Expandable question/answer list

Background #f7f6f3, no radius, padding 20–24px vertical, 1px dashed border on all sides at #1a1614 10% opacity (the dashed hairline is the signature separator style). Question text in Test Signifier 24px weight 400, plus icon right-aligned in Bistre. Expanded state reveals body copy in Geist 16px below the dashed divider.

### Section Header with Monospace Marker
**Role:** Editorial section opener - every major section is numbered and labeled

Two-line composition: top line is "05 · FAQ" or "06 · STAY UP TO DATE" in Geist Mono 10–11px uppercase, letter-spacing 0.1em, color #66635f. Below, the section heading in Test Signifier 36–48px weight 400 in Bistre. A short descriptor paragraph in Geist 20px color #66635f sits beside the heading in a two-column layout for the FAQ section.

### Drop Cap Body Paragraph
**Role:** Long-form editorial content block

First letter of the first paragraph rendered as a large outlined initial cap in Test Signifier at roughly 2.2x the body size, positioned with negative margin to overlap the line above. Body text in Geist 16px line-height 1.5 color Bistre. Used for the "Production engineering, as practiced today…" essay block. Creates a magazine-article cadence uncommon in tech product sites.

### Pull Quote Block
**Role:** Featured testimonial or key statement

Large quote in Test Signifier 36–48px weight 400 with curly opening quote " above, attribution below in Geist 14px - name in Bistre, role/company in Graphite. Quote marks are typographic, not glyphs. Paired with a video thumbnail on the left in a two-column layout. No background, no border - floats in the cream space.

### Video Thumbnail Card
**Role:** Embedded video player surface

Rectangular video still with a centered circular play button (cream fill, dark triangle icon) overlaid. Duration timestamp "2:07" in a small dark pill (#2a2724 background, cream text) bottom-left, brand mark bottom-right. No border or radius beyond a small 4px clip on the timestamp chip. Photographic content is high-contrast with desaturated tones to match the achromatic system.

### Research Log Entry
**Role:** Blog or research post row in a list

Single-line entry with post title in Test Signifier 24px color Bistre, metadata in Geist Mono 10px uppercase tracked: date, author, read time. Title is the link; hover shifts color to Graphite. Separated from neighbors by 1px dashed #1a1614 10% border. Compressed, text-forward, no thumbnails - the list reads like a table of contents.

### Network Visualization Graphic
**Role:** Decorative hero illustration - a dandelion/constellation of connected nodes

Radiating lines from a single center point terminating in small filled circles in four colors: Bistre black, Chartreuse yellow, warm orange (#f59e3a), and olive (#9a9d3e). Lines drawn in Flint at 0.3–0.5px. No animation by default. Occupies the right half of the hero on desktop, sits below headline on mobile. Functions as the only multi-color element on the page.

### View All Outlined Button
**Role:** Tertiary navigation action at section end

Rectangular with 1px solid border in Bistre, Geist 14px weight 500, padding 12px 24px, radius 0. Sits right-aligned in section footers. Subordinate to the dark pill and ghost outlined button - it is the quietest of the three button treatments and never appears in the hero.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Set all headings in Test Signifier weight 400 - never bold the serif, the entire brand identity depends on the quiet authority of regular weight doing display work.
- Use 1px dashed borders in #1a1614 at 10% opacity for all dividers and accordion separators; solid lines are reserved for button outlines and the nav capsule.
- Pair every primary CTA (dark pill) with a secondary ghost outlined button; never let the dark pill stand alone in a button group.
- Number every major section with a Geist Mono 10–11px uppercase marker at letter-spacing 0.1em in #66635f, format as "05 · SECTION NAME".
- Keep the canvas at #d7d7d0 (warm gray) and surfaces at #f7f6f3 (cream); never use pure white or pure black - the warm cast is the signature.
- Reserve chartreuse #e2e67d for single-element accents (one badge, one highlight, one dot); it must never appear as a fill on large surfaces.
- Use the 82px pill radius for the navigation capsule and 9999px for buttons; cards and dividers stay rectangular at 0–4px.

### Don't
- Do not bold any heading - Test Signifier at weight 400 is non-negotiable; introducing 600/700 destroys the editorial register.
- Do not use solid borders for content separators; dashed 1px is the only hairline treatment allowed inside the page.
- Do not place more than one filled dark button per viewport; the dark pill loses authority when repeated.
- Do not introduce saturated blue, red, or green for buttons or alerts; the only chromatic color is the desaturated chartreuse accent.
- Do not use drop shadows on cards or content blocks; depth is achieved through the liquid-glass nav and warm-gray layering only.
- Do not set body text in the serif - Geist handles all body, nav, and UI; the serif is display-only.
- Do not use the network/dandelion graphic in contexts other than the hero; it is a singular signature, not a reusable pattern.

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Parchment Canvas | `#d7d7d0` | Base page background, the warm gray field that everything sits on |
| 1 | Cream Surface | `#f7f6f3` | Content cards, FAQ rows, pull-quote backgrounds - the standard elevated surface |
| 2 | Bone Card | `#fdfcfa` | Lightest surface for content that needs to feel slightly above the cream layer |
| 3 | Quill Line | `#e3e3de` | Hairline borders, ghost button backgrounds, nav capsule resting fill |

## Elevation

Depth is created through warm-gray surface layering and the liquid-glass navigation, never through drop shadows. The only shadows in the system are the inset rgba(0,0,0,0.08) glows on the nav capsule that simulate refraction. Content blocks are flat; separation is communicated by background color shifts and dashed hairlines, not by elevation.

## Imagery

Minimal photographic content. The hero pairs text with a single decorative graphic - a radial network/dandelion of colored dots (black, chartreuse, warm orange, olive) connected by fine lines to a single center point, representing autonomous agents radiating from a system. Video content appears as dark, high-contrast thumbnails with a centered cream play button. The Google logo in the testimonial is rendered as a grayscale image. No lifestyle photography, no product screenshots, no 3D renders. The page is 90% typography and white space; when imagery appears it is either the signature network graphic or a single video frame.

## Layout

Max-width ~1200px centered content with full-bleed warm-gray sections. The hero is a two-column split: headline + subtext + button pair on the left (60% width), network visualization on the right (40%). Below the hero, sections alternate between cream and parchment backgrounds with generous 120px vertical gaps. Section openers use a two-column header: serif heading left, short descriptor right. Content blocks are either two-column (text + media) or single-column centered. The FAQ uses a full-width accordion constrained to the content max-width. The research log is a single-column text list. Navigation is a floating liquid-glass capsule centered at the top, not a full-width bar. Buttons are always paired (filled + ghost) and never stacked alone.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text primary: #1a1614
- text secondary: #66635f
- background canvas: #d7d7d0
- background surface: #f7f6f3
- border hairline: #1a1614 at 10% opacity (dashed)
- accent: #e2e67d
- primary action: no distinct CTA color

**Example Component Prompts**
1. Build a hero section: canvas #d7d7d0, left column has headline "Your headline here" in Test Signifier 54px weight 400 color #1a1614 letter-spacing -1.998px, subtext in Geist 20px line-height 1.5 color #66635f, and a button pair (dark pill #1a1614 fill #f4f4e7 text radius 9999px padding 12.5px 24.5px, plus ghost outlined button 1px solid #1a1614 at 92% radius 0 padding 24px). Right column has the network dandelion graphic - thin lines from one center point to 40+ small filled circles in #1a1614, #e2e67d, warm orange, and olive.

2. Build an FAQ accordion: cream surface #f7f6f3, 1px dashed border #1a1614 at 10% opacity on all sides, no radius, padding 24px vertical. Question text in Test Signifier 24px weight 400 #1a1614, plus icon right-aligned. Section opens with a Geist Mono 10px uppercase marker "05 · FAQ" in #66635f letter-spacing 1px, then a Test Signifier 48px weight 400 heading in #1a1614, with a Geist 20px descriptor in #66635f in a two-column header.

3. Build a pull quote block: no background, large curly quote mark above, quote text in Test Signifier 36px weight 400 #1a1614, attribution in Geist 14px - name in #1a1614, role in #66635f. Pair it with a dark video thumbnail on the left with a centered circular cream play button and a "2:07" timestamp chip in #2a2724 at bottom-left.

4. Build a research log entry row: 1px dashed bottom border #1a1614 at 10% opacity, padding 20px vertical, title in Test Signifier 24px weight 400 #1a1614, metadata prefix in Geist Mono 10px uppercase tracked 1px #66635f reading "04/16/2026" and author + read time, separator dot in Geist 16px #66635f.

5. Build the navigation capsule: floating pill with 82px radius, backdrop-filter blur(12px) saturate(1.75), semi-transparent fill #cfcfc8bd, inset shadow rgba(0,0,0,0.08) 0 0 10px 0, 1px hairline border. Left: nav links in Geist 14px weight 500 #1a1614. Center: wordmark with small icon. Right: "Sign In" text link in Geist 14px + dark pill button #1a1614 fill #f4f4e7 text radius 9999px.

## Motion & Glass Philosophy

Antimetal's motion is restrained but expressive: 0.15–0.3s durations with cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) easing on color, background, border, and stroke transitions. The signature glass effect uses layered backdrop-filter: blur(8–24px) saturate(1.75–1.8) brightness(1.1) combined with an SVG liquid-glass filter for refraction. A single 'pulse' animation runs on the network graphic's center point. Longer 0.6–0.7s eases with cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1) handle entrance animations on scroll. Never use linear easing; never animate layout properties.

## Editorial Conventions

Antimetal treats every page like a printed research document. Specific conventions: section numbering as monospace eyebrows ("05 · FAQ"), drop caps on first paragraphs of long-form blocks, curly typographic quote marks (not straight), en-dashes in metadata, and dashed 1px hairlines as the sole separator style. The Test Signifier serif is set with negative letter-spacing at all sizes above 24px (-0.021em at 48px, -0.037em at 54px) - this tightens the serif's natural rhythm and keeps large headlines from feeling loose or decorative.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** - Same cream/gray paper feel, same generous whitespace, same restraint in UI chrome - though Linear is more geometric and Antimetal is more editorial
- **Anthropic** - Same custom serif for headlines at weight 400, same warm neutral palette, same quiet authority through typographic restraint rather than visual volume
- **Stripe** - Same editorial use of serif type for technical product marketing, same dashed-border detail treatment, same warm off-white surfaces
- **Felt** - Same warm gray canvas with cream surfaces, same pill-shaped navigation, same approach of letting typography carry the brand rather than color
